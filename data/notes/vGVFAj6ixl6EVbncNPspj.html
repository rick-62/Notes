<ul>
<li>how much time is the raw idea worth</li>
<li>how to define the problem</li>
</ul>
<p>First set boundaries on what is being done. It's important not to go into solution mode before ensuring the scope is set, at least in broad terms.</p>
<h4 id="appetite"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#appetite"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Appetite</h4>
<p>Sometimes an idea  gets us excited right away, in which case the excitement needs to be tempered. Should check whether this is something really able to invest time in, before committing resource or hours of long meetings.</p>
<p>Other ideas might be boring. We have been asked to do something we don't particularly want to do. </p>
<p>Appetite split into two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small batch, requiring 1/2 staff 1/2 weeks batched together in 6 week cycles</li>
<li>Large batch, requiring the entire 6 week cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>All projects which don't fit into 6 weeks are broken down or problem narrowed first.</p>

<ul>
<li>Appetite used to vary the scope of the project or work</li>
<li>fixed time determined by the 6 week (or couple week constraint)</li>
</ul>
<p>This <em>fixed time, variable scope</em> principle is applied at each stage of the process, including the shaping process.</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>appetite</em> defines the overarching solution</li>
<li>the <em>fixed time box</em> pushes the decision as to what is core to the project</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="narrowing-the-problem"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#narrowing-the-problem"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Narrowing the problem</h4>
<ul>
<li>Always important to fully understand the problem</li>
<li>Appetite can tell us how much research into the problem we should do</li>
</ul>
<p>The boundary is set once the following three have been achieved:</p>
<ul class="contains-task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> raw idea</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> appetite</li>

<ul>
<li>Sketch out solution at high level</li>
<li>output is idea which solves the problem, but without fine details worked out</li>
<li>Get from ideas in words to the elements of a software solution</li>
<li>Move fast and cover lots of ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>At this stage it is important that the design choices lead to more refined scope and boundary, and not as the intended design. It is also undecided whether the idea is worth committing resource to at this stage and the outcome of this will help to shape that.</p>
<h4 id="move-at-the-right-speed"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#move-at-the-right-speed"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Move at the right speed</h4>
<ul>
<li>Either work alone or with experience/trusted partner who can keep pace</li>
<li>Avoid wrong level of detail: concrete enough to make progress on a solution, without getting dragged down into the details</li>
<li>Work by hand and explore the pros and cons quickly</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions to answer:</p>
<ul class="contains-task-list">

<p><img src="/assets/images/2022-03-15-08-22-25.png">
In this case <em>Invoice</em> and <em>Set up autopay</em> are the places and <em>Turn on autopay</em> is the affordance.</p>
<p>This allows us ot move quickly through ideas and confront problems we may have not originally thought of, with little distraction.</p>

<p>The purpose of this is to use a large pen size to create a rough visual design. The large pen size prevents the ability to go into detail on particular aspects of the design.</p>
<p>This ensures not jumping ahead too much but also encourages us to review problems which haven't initially been thought of.</p>
<p>The output of these sketches is a list of elements, which are specific and narrow.</p>

<p>When people ask for “just a few hours” or “just one day,” don’t be fooled. Momentum and progress are second-order things, like growth or acceleration. You can’t describe them with one point.

You lose the momentum they built up and the time it will take to gain it back. <strong>Losing the wrong hour can kill a day. Losing a day can kill a week</strong></p>

<li>analogous to build the house around the furniture</li>
<li>Can be split into 3 main phases of work:
<ol>
<li>R&#x26;D mode</li>
<li>Production mode</li>
<li>Clean-up mode</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="rd-mode"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#rd-mode"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>R&#x26;D mode</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>We have to learn what we want by building it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adjust for this in 3 ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Instead of betting on well-shaped pitch, bet on time of clarifying key pieces of new idea</li>
<li>Senior staff make up the design team - cannot delegate if don't know what want yourself &#x26; architectural designs will determine what's possible and large decisions may be required in real-time</li>
<li>There is nothing to deliver at the end of the 6-week cycle, except possibly foundations to help shape future work</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="production-mode"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#production-mode"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Production mode</h4>
<p>Once R&#x26;D cycles have sufficiently refined architecture and those decisions are settled, the structure is in place to bring in other teams to contribute.</p>
<p>In production mode:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shaping is deliberate again</li>
<li>Any team can be given the work</li>
<li>Completing features is the goal</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, the product is not launched, but is getting refined.</p>
<h4 id="clean-up-mode"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#clean-up-mode"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Clean-up mode</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>In final phases before launching new product all structure goes out of window</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this stage all remaining bits need to be completed and finalised:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no shaping, with leadership at the helm cutting away distractions and bringing focus to what's important</li>
<li>There aren't clear team boundaries</li>
<li>Work is released in small chunks</li>
</ol>
<p>Clean-up should not last longer than two cycles.</p>

<ol>
<li>Does the problem matter?</li>
<li>Is the appetite right?</li>
<li>Is the solution attractive?</li>
<li>Is it the right time?</li>
<li>Are the right people available?</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>The way to really figure out what needs to be done is to start doing real work.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hand over the project and not tasks</li>
<li>Full responsibility passed over to the team or individual carrying out the work</li>
<li>First few days the teams get acquainted with what has been asked</li>
<li>Team starts off with some imagined tasks, and begin exploring the problem</li>
<li>New tasks are created as the developers try to figure things out</li>
<li>QA/testing needs to be done within the cycle</li>
<li>Communication usually handled after deployment of project/work</li>
