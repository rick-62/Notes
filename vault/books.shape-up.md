- key to project work and software development
- Execution is not everything as things can be executed the wrong way, destroying morale etc
- book explores what executing right looks like
- based around a company called _Basecamp_, who have developed this
- Not waterfall, agile or scrum

## Intro
- guide to how product development is done at _Basecamp_
- and a toolbox of techniques to apply to own process
- for anyone within a business

### Pain points
- projects go on and on
- no time to think strategically about a product
- inability to get things done quickly
- information slipping through the cracks.

> Switched from adhoc project lengths to repeating cycles. Took some experimentation to find the optimal length: 6 weeks.

> **Shaping** used to describe the upfront work to set boundaries and reduce risk on projects before they were committed.

### Six-week cycles
- work in six-week cycles
- long enough to get something meaningful build start to finish
- short enough that the deadline looms from the start, so time used wisely
- majority of features can be built within one six-week cycle
- no micromanagement during this six-week cycle

### Shaping
- work is **shaped** before handing it off to a team or individual
- small senior group works in parallel, who define the key elements of a solution
- projects defined at right level of abstraction
- focus less on estimates and more on appetite: How much time do we want to spend? How much is the idea worth?

> This is the task of shaping: narrowing down the 
problem and designing the outline of a solution that fits within the 
constraints of our appetite.

### Making teams responsible
- full responsiblity given to teams/individuals
- when teams more automomous, senior people can spend less time managing
- with less time managing, more time can be spent **shaping up** better projects
- When projects are better shaped, teams have clearer boundaries and work more autonomously

### Targetting risk
- Risk of: 
    - not shipping on time
    - getting stuck
    - getting bogged down with old projects
    - wasting time on unexpected problems
    - not having future capacity
- Reduce risk in the shaping process by solving open questions before comitting project to a time box 
- Don't give project to a team or individual who is still in a rabbit hole or has tangled interdependencies
- Risk reduced by capping to six weeks
- If project runs over it doesn't get an extension. Artificial cap ensures time is not overly invested on a concept which needs rethinking first.
