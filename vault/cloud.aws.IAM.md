## Overview
IAM is used to manage access/policies for different users as well as roles.

### IAM roles
Roles are an important part of AWS and allow temporary access between different AWS services, which are produced programmatically. This access can be tightly controlled between different services and the actions which can be performed between those services. 

## Recommendations
- MFA
- Separate IAM Users
- IAM user groups to control access for individual users
- controlled IAM roles for API calls betwen AWS services
