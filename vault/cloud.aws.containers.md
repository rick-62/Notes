AWS provides a couple of container orchestration services:
- ECS (Elastic Container Service)
- EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

Necessary to help run and manage lots of containers.

## AWS Fargate
AWS Fargate is a serverless compute platform for ECS or EKS. This is as an alternative to running EC2 instance, removing the need to manage the intricacies of the EC2 instance and shifting the responsibility of patching and updates to Amazon (i.e. serverless)
