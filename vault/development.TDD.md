## TDD Rules
_Clean Architecture in Python_

- Test first, code later
- Add bare minimum code required to pass tests
- Shouldn't have more than one test failing at a time
- Write code to pass test, then refactor
- Test should fail first time ran, otherwise question whether test is needed
- Never refactor code without tests in place
